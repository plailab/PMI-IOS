# plAIful movement interface 2025

A team of researchers from the Plai Lab at Olin College of Engineering will be putting together an interface which is aimed at helping those recovering from cancer by offering users a curriculum with a set of helpful movements and exercises that build muscle and increase flexibility, especially for bed-bound or chair-bound patients. The interface will be suitable for devices with cameras so that it can display live video of the user and augmented reality (AR) objects to make the exercises more engaging through narrative. This project aims to design inclusive technology by serving a user group that has been historically overlooked in the design of versatile digital healthcare tools and would stand to greatly benefit from them.

## Design Goals

The design goals determined at the outset of the project are listed below:

* Easy for older adult to be able to see the components while lying in bed and while sitting on a chair
* Software robustly determines where person’s body parts are 
* System walks person through the steps verbally, including orientation/introduction 
* System check in with person as exercises progress and adjusts based on person’s feedback
* Software guides user through physical activities determined by medical partners, meeting MSKCC Care Curriculum
* Users can navigate exercises, skipping them as necessary
* Activities are playful/engaging
* System components need to be ubiquitous / cheap, so that it’s not too expensive for a person to utilize


## Computational Setup

The following steps are necessary to run the interface on a personal device:

- A high-level summary description of the project’s objectives.
- Additional system diagrams as appropriate.
  - Include diagrams that your team has made that depict relationships between components of your subsystems.
    - These may include electronics schematics, CAD renderings, code UML diagrams, and/or hand-drawings that help us understand connections within and between your software, electrical, and mechanical components.
